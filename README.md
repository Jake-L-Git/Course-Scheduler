# Course-Scheduler

Engineered a 3-tiered course scheduling system that features both a student mode and an administrator mode. Utilized a Java Swing frontend, Derby database backend, and custom Java logic to build the full-stack desktop application.

The logic of the system handles cases such as full classes and updates wailists.

From the administrator point of view, the user can add, delete, and manage classes for different semesters. From the student point of view, they can join classes/waitlists, query existing classes, and manage their semester.
